# Volvo Cars Home Assistant integration

This integration provides access to your Volvo car, provided your model and region are supported by Volvo's public API. This is not a one-to-one replacement for the official Volvo app, as the app has access to more resources than those available through the public API.

Supported regions include: Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. For a complete list of supported countries, check out [Volvo's API documentation](https://developer.volvocars.com/terms-and-conditions/apis-supported-locations/). Even if you're not in one of the listed countries, you might still get lucky! You'll need to try it to find out.

Now check out the features section for details on what you'll get!

| Entity               | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API status           | Sensor | Gives an indication if the Volvo API is online.                                                                                             |
| API request counter  | Sensor | Shows the number of requests made by this integration.                                                                                      |
| Data update interval | Number | Set the data update interval. Default is 135 seconds. Volvo gives you 10.000 requests a day (per API key), so you may want to do some math! |
| Update data          | Button | Force a data refresh.                                                                                                                       |

## ü§ñ Actions

The integration allows you to refresh all data, or only specific parts of the data, by using the `Refresh data` action. This action can be used in automations.

Triggering a data refresh with this action will reset the current refresh timer, postponing the next scheduled full data refresh.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Requirements

- [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) v2024.11.0 or later.

- [Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/).

- You'll also need a Volvo developer account to use this integration. Don't worry, it's free of charge!

  1. Head over to https://developer.volvocars.com/ and make an account. Make sure to use the same e-mail address as your Volvo Id.
  2. Once signed in, go to https://developer.volvocars.com/account/#your-api-applications and create an "API application". Give it some meaningful name.
  3. Repeat step 2 for every additional car **on this account** that you'd like to use with this integration. Repeat the whole process if you have cars on different accounts.

### Install

Add this repository to your HACS with the following button:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=thomasddn&repository=ha-volvo-cars&category=integration)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=volvo_cars)

### Adding your car

Adding your car involves two steps. You'll need to repeat this process for each car you want to add, even if they are on the same account.

Remember to generate an API key for every car. There is a limit on the number of API requests per key.

#### Step 1: fill in credentials

| Field                         | Description                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Username                      | The username of your Volvo Id account.                                                                |
| Password                      | The password of your Volvo Id account.                                                                |
| Vehicle Identification Number | The VIN of the car you want to add.                                                                   |
| Volvo API key                 | The generated API key in the developer account.                                                       |
| Friendly name                 | This value is used in the entity ID (volvo\_[friendly name]\_[key]). If left empty, VIN will be used. |

After submitting, a One Time Password (OTP) will be sent to your email. It's a 6 digit number.

#### Step 2: OTP

Fill in the OTP to complete the process.

### Options

Once a car has been added, you can configure additional options for it.

| Option                        | Description                                                               | Availability                                          |
